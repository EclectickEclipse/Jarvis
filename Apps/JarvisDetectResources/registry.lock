## All lines preceeded with ## are the safest way to avoid the python algorithm
##  accidentally catching and using any commented code. In effect, the algorithm
##  only looks for a specific string of text. This can be changed by changing 
##  the source code to send a value other than 'key:' to 
##  fSearch.search_registry(). The algorithm will see a line beginning with
##  'key.' and instantly pass the rest of the line to the algorithm. To ensure
##  the algorithm avoids any issues at compile time, it shaves off the last 
##  character of the line of text, assuming it has a newline. As such, only one
##  valuable string of text can be stored after a tag on a line.
## The format of the tag you use is specific. It must have a ':' character on
##  the 4th character position. Technically, the preceeding text is redundant,
##  but ensures greater accuracy by the algorithm.
